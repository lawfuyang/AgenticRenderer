# AgenticRenderer

A **Vulkan renderer** project where rendering features are implemented purely through AI agents. This is a personal sandbox to experiment with >99% AI-agentic coding and minimal manual involvement. Expect rapid iterations, exploratory features, and automation-first workflows.

## Approach to AI-Assisted Development

While this project grants AI agents significant autonomy in implementation and design decisions, it remains under **close human supervision**. The workflow is:

1. **AI implements** - Agents autonomously write code, design structures, and solve problems
2. **I review** - All code changes are carefully reviewed for correctness and design
3. **I test** - Features are tested during and after implementation to catch issues early
4. **I iterate** - Problems identified through testing are discussed with agents for refinement
5. **I commit** - Only thoroughly reviewed and tested code is committed to the repository

This ensures quality and control while still leveraging AI for rapid development and exploration.

## Overview

This project aims to build a modern Vulkan rendering engine with features implemented entirely by AI agents, demonstrating the potential of AI-assisted graphics programming. 

## Scope

**Fair warning:** I fully expect the resulting code and file/folder structure to be completely shit. This is an experiment in seeing what happens when AI agents have free reign over a graphics project. The README.md and git commit messages might also be totally AI-generated.
